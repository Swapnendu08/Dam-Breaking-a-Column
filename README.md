# Dam-Breaking-a-Column
It is 2D-symmetrical/3D CFD based project on Dam breaking a Column where we simulate and measure the pressure forces of fluid on impact on the column with COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS.

Wave impact problems are important in engineering of structures, for example in locations where tsunamis are probable. Predicting the forces of waves acting on objects can be
crucial for offshore structures and structures placed near water. If the structure is subjectedto high waves, flooding must also be accounted for. One of the simplest, but widely used,
systems of equations used to model this kind of problem are the shallow water equations.This transient model solves the shallow water equations to model the impact of a water
wave on a column.

The comsole file is too big to upload,that's why a comsole file without results is being uploaded. To see the results and for detailed analysis
